Ignore the rest of the files and run dot_sketch.py, I tried using pretrained models to achieve AI photorealistic images using GPAFAN but it wasn't possible due to some issue with installation
of basicSR. Im still working on that.

I also have an edge_detection script but it wasn't linked.

rembg was used for the background removal.

The Application is still yet to be optimized and further changes would be required.

UI deisgn is simple and clean.
